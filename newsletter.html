        <br>
        <p style="max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: justify;"><b>President:</b> Mohammad Pervaiz- I‚Äôm running for Code for All President because as a sophomore and incoming Bloomberg SWE intern and previous IAC fellow, I can offer both long-term leadership and strong industry connections. I‚Äôm deeply involved on campus‚Äîas a tutor and Campus Ambassador‚Äîand I‚Äôll use those relationships to create real opportunities for members. I believe leadership is about more than technical skills‚Äîit‚Äôs about communication, action, and helping others grow. </p><br>
        <p style="max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: justify;"><b>Vice-President:</b> Ye Htut Maung -  I am with Code for All from the beginning and I helped students via discord and Learning Commons. By winning for the VP position, I will bring more useful workshops to QC students and maintain the Code For All community. <br><br> Thomas Soupionis  - I believe I should win Vice President because I am the co-creator of this club and have been Vice President since the beginning. I would love to end my last semester in fall guiding the next generation of Code for All board members and helping in any area as needed. I‚Äôm in a unique position having data, ML and AI heavy job and project experiences and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôd love to dive deeper into for club events in my last semester. </p><br>
        <p style="max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: justify;"><b>Treasurer:</b>  Eric Salazar - I‚Äôve been part of Code for All since the very beginning, and it's been incredible to see how far we've come as a community. I've proudly helped fund our last two hackathons, as well as every event we've hosted, because I genuinely believe in creating opportunities for everyone in the club. As treasurer, I‚Äôd love to continue supporting our growth and making sure we can keep building amazing experiences together. Plus, my fat orange cat, Bibi, would be more than happy to lend a paw in keeping our finances in check!<br><br>Paulo Criollo - After taking the initiative of nominating myself for treasurer I was thinking of doing something bigger for Code for All and taking responsibility of a dedicated position where every decision is vital for any event or situation the board decides like running budget for workshop food, etc. I think I would make sure that every budget needs will be reached according to the goals of the club.</p><br>
        <p style="max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: justify;"><b>Secretary:</b> Sophia Yau - I‚Äôm passionate about creating innovative and collaborative spaces for people in technology. Code For All has acted as a hub filled with support and encouragement throughout my journey in tech, and I hope to continue that to help and serve others! <br><br> Roshan Jahan -I think I should win because although I‚Äôve never held a club position before, I‚Äôm willing to learn what it takes to be part of the eboard and manage the club along with everyone else! Moreover my expected grad date is May 2027 so it allows me more time to contribute to the club for longer        </p><br>
